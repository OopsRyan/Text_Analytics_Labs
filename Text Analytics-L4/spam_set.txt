any news on iPhone x JOD pricing?
Note: do not use iPhone x images in your app’s screenshots. It will get rejected.
I will die if I don’t get the iPhone X! They say there’s 50mill in demand but only 12mill being sold on the preorder
Is there any other mobile service provider other than the dreaded Jio that's offering deals on iPhone X? Uhhh
I’ve researched comparisons with the iPhone 8 vs. the iPhone X. Seems the only difference is the appearance & facial recognition?
The #pixel2xl is barely cheaper than the iPhone X though. I think I’ll wait and see but I have a chrome cast and don’t want an Apple TV etc. Phones are just super expensive now.
I tweeted SS of shell app for iPhone X they banned it..
Very limited sample and the low res pictures didn’t help but this survey reinforces my thoughts that the white iPhone X will be v.popular 
Got me an upgrade but imma wait til that iPhone X come out.
Was paying my Verizon bill and it said I’m eligible for an update... about to get the iPhone X when it drops
